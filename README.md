# 🛠️ scripts

My personal collection of shell scripts I use to automate, simplify, or speed up daily tasks. This repo is an evolving toolbox primarily for macOS, but many scripts are portable to Linux.

## 📁 Organization

- `choose/` — Scripts that integrate with [`choose-gui`](https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/choose) for fast fuzzy selection in a popup, similar to rofi or dmenu on linux.
- `stuff/` — Stores files used by the scripts, such as a list of all emojis.
- `term/` — Terminal workflow enhancements and productivity tools.

## 🧰 Dependencies

Some scripts rely on:
- bash or zsh
- choose-gui
- ffmpeg (for the cam script)
- You probably already have these:
  - grep
  - cat
  - sed

## 🧠 Inspiration

Many of these scripts were inspired by:

- [Sylvan Franklin](https://github.com/SylvanFranklin)
- [Bread on Penguins](https://github.com/BreadOnPenguins)
- [Luke Smith](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz)

as well as an attempt on my part to make using my computer the way I like it easier and faster.
